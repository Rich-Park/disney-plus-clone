## Additional Resources
- [Disney+ Clone Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_OERlafbmw) that I followed to build the foundation of the app, but refactored by making database rendering code in row components reusable and implementing SCSS styling rather than styled components
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
